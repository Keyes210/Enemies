# Enemies
ORIGINAL, complete. An app about about the people you hate. 


This is a pretty simple note taking app. I wanted to make it unique, so it serves a very specific purpose. The idea is you that list your enemies and the reasons why. <br />

Users can add Enemies to their list. Long presses of each list item bring up the option to edit or delete. A short press leads to another page, where users can add reasons why the enemy is on their list. Reasons can also be edited or deleted via long press. Enemies and Reasons are saved when the app is closed or just stopped.<br />

<h4>
<span style="font-weight: normal;">Small Features</span></h4>
<ul>
<li>Every user entry has a character limit, and if they are exceeded, confirmation buttons are disabled.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The reason entry has a character count that turns red when exceeded.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>When a user edits something, the original text appears in the edittext and with a cursor at the end. It sounds like not that big a deal, but it took some work to figure out.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A beautiful floating action button that disappears while scrolling the list. I used&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/makovkastar/FloatingActionButton">this library</a>&nbsp;for it.</li>
</ul>
